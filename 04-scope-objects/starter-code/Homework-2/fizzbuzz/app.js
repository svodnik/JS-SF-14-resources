// Relying on your newfound knowledge of loops, combine loops and if/else statements together and incrementally build the common fizzbuzz loop.

// - In the loop, every time a number is divisible by **3**, instead of logging the number itself, the word "fizz" should appear.
// - If the number is divisible by  **5**, the word "buzz" should be logged.
// - If the number is divisible by both **3** and  **5**, then the word "fizzbuzz" should be logged.

// Follow the steps below.

// ##### Step 1:
// Construct a for loop that iterates through, and `console.log()`'s out, numbers 1 - 100.

// ##### Step 2:
// Add an `if/else` statement that logs the string `"fizz"` if the value being iterated over is divisible by `3`; otherwise, log out the value.

// ##### Step 3:
// Add an `else if` clause that logs the string `"buzz"` if the value being iterated over is divisible by `5`.

// ##### Step 4:
// Add an additional `else if` clause that logs the string `"fizzbuzz"` if the value being iterated over is divisible by both `3` and `5`.

//##### BONUS:

// a. Make a copy of your existing code and comment out the original.
// b. In the new copy, instead of using console.log for the results, push the
//    result of each loop to an array.
// c. After all iterations have, completed, use the forEach array method to log
//    each array element value to the console.
//    Label your console output with the original number and a colon before each
//    array value. (Hint: How can you shorten your code using a second forEach
//    function parameter?)
